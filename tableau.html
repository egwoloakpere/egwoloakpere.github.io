								Tableau is a powerful and versatile data visualization tool used in the business intelligence industry. It allows users to create 
								interactive and shareable dashboards that display data insights in a visually appealing way. Tableau can connect to various data 
								sources such as Excel, SQL databases, and cloud services, enabling users to analyze large datasets and uncover trends, patterns, 
								and outliers. With its drag-and-drop interface and extensive customization options, Tableau makes it easy for users to create complex
								visualizations without the need for coding. Its ability to blend and transform data, create calculated fields, and use advanced analytics
								features makes it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making. Here, I will share with you some of the	projects I have done 
								using TABLEAU. These projects involves; Identify the needs of users, create data visualization using Tableau, and use design thinking to 
								improve dashboards. Find some of my projects below.

									<h2><a>Phiyo Hospital Flu Dashboard</a></h2>
									<p>In 2022, the flu, also known as influenza, continued to be a significant global health concern. The flu is a contagious
										 respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild
										  to severe illness and, in some cases, can lead to hospitalization or even death.</p>

								<a class="image main"><img src="Flu.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Each year, the flu season varies in severity, with different strains of the virus circulating. Vaccination is a key strategy for
									 preventing the flu and reducing its impact. The flu vaccine is updated annually to match the circulating flu viruses and is
									  recommended for everyone over six months of age, especially for those at higher risk of complications, such as young children,
									   pregnant women, older adults, and individuals with certain medical conditions. 
									   The work displayed in this dashboard explores a public dataset gotten from Synthea. 
										The study was preceded by an elaborate and up-to-date analysis using Structure Queried language (SQL) and 
										visualization with Tableau.</p>
