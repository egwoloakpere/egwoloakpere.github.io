								SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases.
								It allows users to query, insert, update, and delete data, as well as create and modify database structures such as
								tables, views, and indexes. SQL is essential for working with databases in various applications, from small personal 
								projects to large enterprise systems. Here, I will share with you some of the projects I have done using Structured
								Query language. These projects involves; Perform SQL queries, sort and filter data using SQL queries, and Convert data
								types using SQL functions. Find some of my projects below.

										<h2><a>DATAWAREHOUSE PROJECT</a></h2>
										<p style="text-align: left;">This project involves different stages including:
											<ol style="text-align: left;">
											<li>Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.</li>
											<li>ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.</li>
											<li>Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.</li>
										</ol></p>
										 <p style="text-align: left;">This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in SQL Development,
										Data Architecture, Data Engineering, ETL Pipeline Developing, and Data Modeling. This project was carried out  using Structure Queried language (SQL).</p>

										<h2><a>Murder Mystery</a></h2>
										<p style="text-align: left;">A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, 
										but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018
										 and that it took place in SQL City. The work reported in this study investigates extensively a murder case by
										  carrying out an elaborate analysis using Structure Queried language (SQL).</p>

										<h2><a>Flu Analysis</a></h2>
										<p style="text-align: left;">In 2022, the flu, also known as influenza, continued to be a significant global health concern. The flu is a contagious
											respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild
											 to severe illness and, in some cases, can lead to hospitalization or even death. The work reported in this study explores 
											 and discuss extensively on a public dataset gotten from Synthea. The study was preceded by an elaborate and up-to-date analysis
											 using Structure Queried language.</p>

									<p style="text-align: left;">Each year, the flu season varies in severity, with different strains of the virus circulating. Vaccination is a key strategy for
										preventing the flu and reducing its impact. The flu vaccine is updated annually to match the circulating flu viruses and is
										 recommended for everyone over six months of age, especially for those at higher risk of complications, such as young children,
										  pregnant women, older adults, and individuals with certain medical conditions.</p>
