								<!-- Text stuff -->
								Tableau is a powerful and versatile data visualization tool used in the business intelligence industry. It allows users to create 
								interactive and shareable dashboards that display data insights in a visually appealing way. Tableau can connect to various data 
								sources such as Excel, SQL databases, and cloud services, enabling users to analyze large datasets and uncover trends, patterns, 
								and outliers. With its drag-and-drop interface and extensive customization options, Tableau makes it easy for users to create complex
								visualizations without the need for coding. Its ability to blend and transform data, create calculated fields, and use advanced analytics
								features makes it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making. Here, I will share with you some of the	projects I have done 
								using TABLEAU. These projects involves; Identify the needs of users, create data visualization using Tableau, and use design thinking to 
								improve dashboards. Find some of my projects below.

									<h2><a>Unleashing the Power of HR Analytics: Data-Driven Workforce Strategies </a></h2>
									<p>HR analytics, also known as people analytics, leverages data and statistical methods to optimize human resource functions, 
									enhance employee experiences, and align workforce strategies with business goals. By analyzing metrics such as recruitment 
									efficiency, employee performance, retention rates, and engagement levels, HR analytics enables organizations to make evidence-based
									 decisions that directly impact productivity and profitability.</p>
								</header> 
								<a class="image main"><img src="HR-analytics.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>For example, predictive analytics can forecast employee turnover, allowing HR teams to proactively implement retention strategies. 
								Similarly, talent acquisition data can identify the most effective recruitment channels, ensuring the right talent is brought onboard 
								efficiently. Beyond numbers, HR analytics fosters a culture of continuous improvement, where data insights are used to empower employees
								 and support organizational growth.</p>

									<h2><a>Driving Insights with Data: A Comprehensive Sales and Customer Dashboard </a></h2>
									<p>This Sales and Customers Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance and customer behavior, enabling 
									data-driven insights to guide strategic decision-making. It was designed to track key metrics such as sales growth/decline,
									profit, quantity, orders, customer acquisition, and customer retention, empowering stakeholders to understand and respond
									 to market trends in real-time.</p>
								</header> 
								<a class="image main"><img src="Sales.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Key Features include; A time-series visualization of sales and Profit over different periods (weekly and monthly) to track
								 performance trends and identify peak sales periods, breakdowns of customers by purchase frequency and  sales/profit generated,
								  giving a clear picture of customer behavior & preferences and a ranked list of top-performing customers. This dashboard 
								  equips stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, tailor marketing efforts, and enhance customer 
								   experience. It’s particularly valuable for sales teams, marketing strategists, and customer service teams looking to drive

									<h2><a>Parameters in Tableau</a></h2>
									<p>Parameters act as versatile placeholders that users can adjust to impact visualizations and calculations, offering an
									 elevated level of flexibility and user interactivity. Parameters extend the interactivity of a dashboard by allowing users
									  to control values such as thresholds, time periods, target metrics, and categorical options. This flexibility enables
									   users to create dynamic comparisons, switch between measures, and fine-tune what data they see without needing to
									    adjust underlying data sources or develop a new visualization.</p>
								</header> 
								<a class="image main"><img src="Parameters.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>For example, with parameters, users can toggle between different Metrics/Measures (like Sales, Profit, Quantity, etc.) and 
								Dimensions (like Country, City, Product_category, etc.) within a single visualization. Parameters aren’t just interactive 
								elements; they elevate dashboards into analytical tools, empowering users to explore data intuitively and tailor 
								visualizations to their unique perspectives. Explore parameters below.</p>

									<h2><a>Phiyo Hospital Flu Dashboard</a></h2>
									<p>In 2022, the flu, also known as influenza, continued to be a significant global health concern. The flu is a contagious
										 respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild
										  to severe illness and, in some cases, can lead to hospitalization or even death.</p>
								</header>
								<a class="image main"><img src="Flu.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Each year, the flu season varies in severity, with different strains of the virus circulating. Vaccination is a key strategy for
									 preventing the flu and reducing its impact. The flu vaccine is updated annually to match the circulating flu viruses and is
									  recommended for everyone over six months of age, especially for those at higher risk of complications, such as young children,
									   pregnant women, older adults, and individuals with certain medical conditions. 
									   The work displayed in this dashboard explores a public dataset gotten from Synthea. 
										The study was preceded by an elaborate and up-to-date analysis using Structure Queried language (SQL) and 
										visualization with Tableau.</p>
